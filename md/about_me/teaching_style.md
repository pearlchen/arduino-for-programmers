## Teaching style of this workshop

Two philosophies I keep in mind when I teach workshops:

- ** If someone does something better than you, don't re-invent the wheel -- just piggyback off of them ;) **

    So having said stated that, we'll be working directly off of some of the tutorials from [SparkFun](http://sparkfun.com) where this stuff was ordered from. Or [Adafruit](http://adafruit.com), my other favourite online retailer.
    
- ** People learn at different speeds -- don't fight it, work with it. **

    Because much of the training materials are available in writing (or sometimes video), you get to pace _yourself_ over the tutorials for parts of this workshop.

    I'm here as your learning **faciliator**. If you get **stuck** on a guide or want to ask more **advanced questions**, just get my attention!
