My school and work history is a bit all over the placeâ€¦

This means I made my living off making software for the web or websites. Making things for the web is actually where I feel most at "home".

But I always thought that there's more to life than a mouse, a keyboard, and a flat screen so I also did a smattering of art installations. More recently, I was the _Research & Tech Manager_ at the CFC Media Lab so I got paid to do this.

Nowadays, I focus more on **education and educators** rather than artists. This means doing workshops like this or making technology more accessible to a wider range of people (e.g. [Ladies Learning Code](http://ladieslearningcode.com) or [Maker Kids](http://makerkids.ca)).

Or building tools for educators. (e.g. Putting tablets in the hands of every student for a PhD research project at OISE/UofT.)
