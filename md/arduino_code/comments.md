## Comments

When you need to make a note to yourself or to other humans reading your code, use _comments_.

Comments are ignored by the Arduino compiler so they don't take up any space.

** Single line comment: **

```
// note to self
```

** Comment spanning multiple lines: **

```
/* 
multi-
line
comment
*/
```
