## Conditionals

_Conditionals_ are used for logic branching. They allow for different outcomes depending on the _condition_ being tested.

A simple "if" test:

```
if ( condition test ) {
  // statements to execute if condition test resolves to true
} 
```

A simple "if/else" test:

```
if ( condition test ) {
  // statements to execute if condition test resolves to true
} else {
  // statements to execute if condition test DOES NOT resolve to true
}
```
