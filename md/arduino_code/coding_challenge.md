## Coding challenge

Make an Arduino "game" that keeps score:

- Progress the colour of the LED from red (to blue) to green each time you click on the button (like points)

- When you read green: buzzzzzzzzzz (you win!)

- Bonus: try to remove points when your light sensor is blocked (like an opponent)
