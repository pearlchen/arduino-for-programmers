## Electricity & Electronics

Read [http://www.tigoe.net/pcomp/code/circuits/understanding-electricity](http://www.tigoe.net/pcomp/code/circuits/understanding-electricity) at your leisure at home to revisit Voltage, Current, Amps, and Ohm's Law.

### Current

The **magnitude** of the flow of electrons in a circuit. It is measured in _Amperes_, or _Amps_. 

Visual: If electricity was flowing through a pipe, it's the amount of water/electricity flowing past a certain point. 

### Voltage

The electrical **energy** of a circuit. It is measured in _Volts_.

Visual: The amount of water pressure in the pipe. A dripping facuet is low voltage and a firehose is high voltage.

### Resistance

A materialâ€™s **ability to oppose** the flow of electricity. It is measured in _Ohms_.

Visual: Putting a sponge into a pipe -- limits the current (and voltage) but electricity still flows past.
