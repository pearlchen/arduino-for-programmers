## Controlling a Servo Motor

Pulse Coded Modulation is very similar to Pulse Width Modulation that you came across during the fading LED example.

“The length of the pulse will determine how far the motor turns. A 1.5 millisecond pulse, for example, will make the motor turn to the 90 degree position (often called the neutral position). If the pulse is shorter than 1.5 ms, then the motor will turn the shaft to closer to 0 degress. If the pulse is longer than 1.5ms, the shaft turns closer to 180 degrees.”
