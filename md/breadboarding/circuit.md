## Circuits

A curcuit is a closed loop that contains a source of energy and a load. 

Loads could be things like lightbulbs. Generally speaking, it's anything that will convert electrical energy into a new form of energy.

Examples:

- Light Emitting Diodes = light energy 
- Speakers = sound pressure
