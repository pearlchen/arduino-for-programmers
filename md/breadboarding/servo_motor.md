## Servo Motor

![Inside a Servo Motor](images/servo_motor_inside.png)

“The servo motor has some control circuits and a potentiometer (a variable resistor, aka pot) that is connected to the output shaft. In the picture above, the pot can be seen on the right side of the circuit board. This pot allows the control circuitry to monitor the current angle of the servo motor. If the shaft is at the correct angle, then the motor shuts off. If the circuit finds that the angle is not correct, it will turn the motor the correct direction until the angle is correct. The output shaft of the servo is capable of travelling somewhere around 180 degrees.”

“The angle is determined by the duration of a pulse that is applied to the control wire. This is called **Pulse Coded Modulation**. The servo expects to see a pulse every 20 milliseconds (.02 seconds).“
