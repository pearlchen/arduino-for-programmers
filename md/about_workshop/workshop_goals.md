## Workshop goals

![image](images/agenda.jpg)

This is a **3 hour** workshop (with some extra time at the end). 

That's not enough time to become an expert in Arduino and electronics but what I hope you'll get out of today will be:

- Learn what an Arduino is, the types of projects that are possible, and the different form factors it comes in

- The basics of Arduino programming such as:
  - the `loop()` and `setup()` functions
  - controlling an output (e.g. make an LED blink)
  - reading input (e.g. knowing when a button is pushed)
  - analog versus digital pins

- Wiring up curcuits on a breadboard
  - Voltage and power sources
  - Ohms Law
  - How to read a resistor
  - Creating circuits

- Where to go from here
