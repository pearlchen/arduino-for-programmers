## ProtoSnap pins

The pins on an Arduino are where you hook up connections to power and to sensors/actuators.

They are typically grouped together by features:

- Power supply (Vcc) and ground (GND)
- Digital in/out pins
- Analog in
- Serial transmission (RX/TX)

And they always have a pin number.
