# What are sketches

Arduino programs are referred to as "sketches" -- they should be quick and easy like picking up a pencil and making a doodle.

The language is based on _[Wiring](http://wiring.org.co/)_ and code is a simplied version of C++. Arduino has a lot in common with [Processing](http://processing.org/) which is simplified Java.

(Note: If you want to write libraries for Arduino, you can write it fully in C++ using .cpp and .h files.)
