## Intro to the ProtoSnap

![ProtoSnap - don't break it apart!](images/protosnap_warning.png)

Today we're using this PCB (_Printed Curcuit Board_) with built in components called the [ProtoSnap Pro Mini](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10889) from Sparkfun.  

It's an _Arduino-compatible_ board meaning that it's not an official Arduino product. But since Arduino is _Open Source_, this is allowed and encouraged when you want to make your own special Arduino formfactor.
