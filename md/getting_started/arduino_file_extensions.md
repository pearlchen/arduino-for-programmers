# Arduino file extensions and folders

For Arduino 1.0+, files have an **.ino** extension.

For Arduino 0093 and lower, files have a **.pde** extension (same as Processing).

All sketches must be in a folder of the same name. (e.g. `MyArduinoSketch.ino` must be in a folder named `MyArduinoSketch`.)

Sketches can be saved anywhere but will default to what's set in your Arduino preferences. (e.g. `/Users/Pearl/Documents/Arduino` on my Mac)
