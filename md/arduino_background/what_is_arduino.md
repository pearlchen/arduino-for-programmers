### Arduino is _hardware_

The Arduino _Uno_ is a small and inexpensive computer with CPU, RAM, Flash memory, and input/output pins -- all on a single chip (an ATmega chip).

Unlike your computer or a Raspberry Pi, it's designed to control electricity directly and that includes the ability to attach all kinds of sensors, LEDs, and motors.

The newest Arduino _Due_ actually has an ARM processor -- that's the same as your smartphone!
